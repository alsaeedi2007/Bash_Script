# Bash_Script
This repo contains bash scripts, that serves different purposes 

## Main script 
this script purpose is to create a script file when needed, as you know we need to create a folder for each script, and create a script file inside it, start writing script, save the script and give `execute permission` for the file. 
all the above steps written in a script, so we need to just run the script and provide ( pass ) the scrip name as an argument to the main script.
